Kurt is a small portable web server for use with Nu.

It is based on the libevent event notification library
(http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/), and has been tested
on OS X 10.5 and Linux (Ubuntu-7.10) systems. 
	
REQUIREMENTS

Kurt requires Nu and nuke, the Nu build tool. To obtain
Nu, please visit http://programming.nu or get the source
from the Nu git repository on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/nu
	
Kurt requires libevent. Before building Kurt, please 
be sure that libevent is installed on your system. The
default build configuration expects libevent to be installed
in /usr/local.

Helpers for working with URL query strings have been 
factored out into a separate project, NuHTTPHelpers, 
which is now required to run Kurt.

On Linux systems, Kurt requires an implementation of the
Foundation classes. It is has been successfully used with
the GNUStep base library on Debian Linux systems.
	
The primary Kurt repository is on github:
	http://github.com/timburks/kurt
	
INSTALLATION

After installing all prerequisites, build the Kurt framework
by typing "nuke" in the top-level Kurt directory.

AN EXAMPLE

Let's start with the simplest possible Kurt app:

==============================================
#!/usr/local/bin/nush
(load "Kurt")

(get "/"
	"hello!")

(Kurt run)
==============================================

Kurt can also be run from the command line using the "kurtd" 
(kurt daemon) script.  kurtd accepts arguments that can
be used to specify a port and a site description. 

But the recommended way to run Kurt services is by writing
them in a single file, as above, with components factored
out into subfiles as deemed necessary. A sample such instance
is in the sample directory in the "sampled" file. To run
it, just run:
	sampled
	
The sample site is very simple, but illustrates the processing 
of GET and POST requests and the basics of response generation, 
including the use of cookies.

INFLUENCES

Kurt is modeled on Blake Mizerany's Sinatra, 
	http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/
but has the clarity and transparency of implementation
that can only be achieved with Objective-C and Nu.

Kurt is named after your favorite famous Kurt: Vonnegut,
Cobain, even Russell if you like, and this definition from
the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language:

curt (k√ªrt)
1. Rudely brief or abrupt, as in speech or manner. See Synonyms at gruff.
2. Using few words; terse.
3. Having been shortened.

In an earlier, more verbose era, Kurt was known as Nunja.
